LoginTestThing
==============

This is a half-assed 15-minute coding project to throw out a login system using MySQL + PHP.

This uses the MySQL library from [http://github.com/roncli/PHP-MySQLi-Class](http://github.com/roncli/PHP-MySQLi-Class ""). Very **very** handy library! :)

Somebody wanted me to create an example of a login system and so I made this up. I also included the database SQL export so that people can start from there.

Usage:
------
These are the two default accounts inside the database.
Account 1:
	Username: user1
	Password: pass1

Account 2:
	Username: user2
	Password: pass2
